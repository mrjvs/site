[Designcourse](https://designcourse.com) is a course platform built from the ground up for popular Youtuber [Gary Simon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyRiMvfUNMA1UPlDPzG5Ow).

Traditional course platforms did not offer the level of flexiblity that Gary required both for styling and functionality of the overall platform.

As with any full-stack application, there were three main parts of Designcourse each assigned to a different person:

- Gary produced Designcourse's design himself.
- [Jip](https://jipfr.nl) was commissioned to translate the designs into front-end HTML and CSS.
- I am responsible for producing the back-end application, intergrating the front-end into the backe-end and also managing the infrastructure.
