            <Paragraph>
              NeatoJS is a project that I started to address issues that I had
              with existing libraries and tools in the JavaScript ecosystem.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Currently consists of a config library for strongly typed and
              validated runtime configuration, and a flexible documentation tool
              that looks good out of the box.

            <Paragraph>
              Statulo is a project I started with a buddy because most uptime trackers I tried were either too limited, too expensive, or don't feel nice to use.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Itâ€™s still early, but the goal is simple: Cheap, reliable and it must feel nice to use.
