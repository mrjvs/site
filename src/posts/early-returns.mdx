# Early exits aren't bad practice!

When writing code you will often have to check for a bunch of conditions before the logic of your function or endpoint.

Students are usually taught to avoid multiple exit conditions and only have one of them inside your function. However this practice leads bugs and harder to read code.

Let's take an example of a function that adds a comment to a social media post:
 - If post is restricted, only some users can comment. Otherwise everybody can.
 - User can not comment if you are blocked by the author.
 - User must have their email verified.
 - Comment must be

```ts
function createCommentOnPost(user: User, post: Post, comment: string): boolean {
  let result = false;

  if (!post.isRestricted || post.canUserComment(user)) {
    if (!user.hasBlocked(post.author)) {
      if (user.emailVerified) {
        if (comment.length > 0) {
          if (!containsSwearWords(comment)) {

            result = true;
          }

        }
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

  This causes very nested code and makes it hard to trace what logic is applied where
